According to recent research 80% of leaders today failed to impress in the 1st 2 years. Their leadership roles 70% admit to being incredibly stressed. Over 70% admit to not enjoying the job. Gone are the days when we used to have a job for life. Today people stay in a job for four years and within the millennials. That's only three years. When I saw those statistics I was terrified. I'm in the middle of my career but that doesn't mean that great leadership isn't around us. It's all around us. So I've been writing a book about leadership about emotional intelligence trying to find what the common denominator the X factor of great leadership is. And I did. I started this a couple of years ago and I started where everybody starts research and that's on Google on DH. A typed in great leadership on DH thes are some of the faces that came upon the very first page of Google. A couple of observations. Firstly you'll know them all probably. Secondly if I'd have given you an intelligent audience the opportunity to think of a category or a heading where you could sandwich Captain Kirk between Mother Teresa A Martin Luther King. I bet you couldn't have done it but there is. So excuse me. So these are all the people that way we know and love. I've got twin boys nine years of age and I asked them in the kitchen the other week Who do you think is a great leader on Oliver? Said Barack Obama. Nine years of age and he picked probably one of the most influential leaders of our time. William pick me. 50 pages are searched in Google. Couldn't find a single picture of me anywhere. But I take take solace in the fact that they're twins. You know they're pretty similar. And follow this so right. William can't be so wrong. But great leadership isn't reserved to those famous people that we see here. You're no great leaders. I've been privileged enough to work for a couple of great leaders. I've got friends and peers and some of those are great leaders. Had a great leader is work for me. So what is the X factor of great leadership? Well according to the research I've done I'll tell you what It's no contrary to popular belief. Great leadership isn't like you is an entry point. It certainly helps. But it's not like I know some really clever people were failed in a number of leadership positions. It's not privilege. Some of those people weren't born into money privilege. They weren't building into educational privilege. It's not job title as nice as it is to have CEO or chairman next year name job titles actually listed as one of the top 10 reasons why leaders fail because they rely on that title for respect. So within my research have been looking for the common denominator and how do we categorise that emotional intelligence? And it's frustrating because it's been stigmatised for so long. It's woolly It's a black art. It's soft management. You can't measure it. Well maybe you can't measure it and just because it's emotion doesn't mean it's not important. Some of the most significant events on earth happened because of emotion. So what I'd like to do today is pick three of those common denominators just three on offer it to you as an audience of point is three pointers for great leadership and I'll start with people. Now. People covers the whole spectrum of stuff. But what I'd like to do is concentrate on Connexion. Every leader needs a Connexion with people. But if you need a Connexion with people you have to have a Connexion with yourself. You have to know yourself fully. Self reflection is one of the cornerstones of great leadership understanding yourself knowing what makes you happy. What makes you sad? What makes him motivated? What gives you those negative feelings that sometimes have a negative output but self reflections? Nothing without so self regulation. If you can't regulate you're your response. When your emotions tell you something else well then we have a problem. So self regulation is essential. Everybody's got an ego. The great leaders that you saw there A ll have a pretty small ego with the exception of Captain Kirk who has a huge ironically the size of a planet actually. But everybody's got any go. I've got an ego. You all in this room have any go and sometimes it's essential to take a tactical bruise on the ego for the betterment of an organisation. So that's self reflection self regulation. And then we have to look at self perception. Your perception of yourself has to be a CZ close toe. Other people's reality was possible. If you think you're great and open and honest and your team don't well then you've got a disconnect and you've got a problem if you think you're really shy and you don't really say what you want to say. But your team think that you are quite outspoken you've gotta disconnect in your problem. Your perception of yourself has to be a close toe. Other people's reality a cz possible. So we work in those three things. Andi is a never ending journey. You'll never master it. You know it's something that you'll carry on and off doing and then you have to create a safe environment. And I'm not talking safe in the traditional sense hard heartened boots. I'm talking about creating a climate where people are able to say and do what they need to say and do but the leaders that terrifying because it means feedback. Now we all know that feedbacks a gift but if we're honest with ourselves it also hurts. But it's essential in great leadership. You also need to create this climate to share ideas. No leader should think they're an exhaustive list of ideas because nobody is create this climate this open climate. If you can concentrate on those three things have an open climate then you have every chance of Connexion. With Connexion comes creativity and nothing amazing happens in this Earth without creativity so that people second vision no somebody Nelson Mandela said. Action without vision is passing time vision with our actions daydreaming. But vision and action Khun Change the world and Nelson Mandela changed the world. If you want your company to drive if you want your sports team to drive. If you want your performing arts centre to drive you have to give them a destination because driving without a destination means you just get lost. So give a vision make it compelling. Making out there make exciting make it challenging. It can't be easy. If it was easy chances are people have already done it. Put it out there designed some stops and celebrations along the way because it's hard to stay motivated for what might be 345 years. What a vision isn't is meet your end of year results your revenue and he bit daren cash. It's not be Everton on a Wednesday night. It's not done. She socks off in the matinee on a Saturday maybe all essential things that you need in orderto reach your vision. But that's not a vision. Division needs to be compelling. And when you have a vision I always say to companies Draw it. There's no secret as to why in a company Christmas queers you'll always get that question right down your vision and mission and everybody's going off. Which Bill was there is revised up for three years. It's probably just about nailed it. Nobody remembers strings of words so write it drowned. Draw draw where you are today draw away. You want to be tomorrow. Draw the path of how to get their free MIT. Put it on the office wall or the sports centre or your dance studio. Everybody will know what the vision is. They might verbalise it differently but they'll know what it is. I forget my birthday every year but I could draw you a picture I saw 10 years ago so that people vision Final one passion a leader without passion and enthusiasm lacks credibility. You don't believe them. We've all seen them there. Stand there in front of the board and it's a very passionate about this. You think don't feel like it feels like you're lying to me. Give people that passion on. There's a thing. Passion and enthusiasm is an emotion like every other emotion. When you see somebody laughing on TV you want to laugh with them. When you watched Titanic and you see that guy sing Kony drowns you want to cry? Those films are designed to play on your emotion. Give people emotion. Martin Luther King didn't say We've got the people will get us to the promised land. You didn't say it like that. He belted it out. Talk about films being designed to trigger the emotion. Braveheart. He didn't say it could take a large but they won't take a freedom. He shouted it and everybody shouted with him When you're watching it you were compelled. Even Kylie Minogue belted hour. I should be so lucky. Lookie lookie lookie. We all felt looking and a final thought on passion and it comes from a mindset. The's leaders that you know the leaders up there or do strategic mental rehearsal have all imagined reaching the goal in the mind that probably done it 10 or 20 times. They've imagine the steps on the way that tasted it. They felt it. Research suggests people who do Assam are more likely to achieve their goals. You see sports people do it. I was talking to Duncan. Good. You He did it before his gold medal. I flew into an air field about six months ago with my uncle and I'll sit in their property. You do? When you British on DH There was an air display you going on and there was this guy was probably 60. Experienced pilot one piece flights who? And he closed his eyes. He didn't know we were watching. He put his arms out closed his eyes. He start to move. They started to do this with his hands altering the throttle move in The young he was rehearsing is fat. It was honestly fascinating to watch and I went up to him. Andi said You know you're doing the display. A reflection a crazy thing to ask. A guy in a onesie pretended to be a plane with his arms out But when we got over that he said Yeah I said Do you do that often he said. I can't fly. I can't do a display unless a reverse it in my mind is probably than those moves 20 times before in the air. But he can't do a display. This is rehearsed it and that's where he gets his drive and passion from strategic mental rehearsal. So there's my three things people vision passion the great leaders that you know. The great leaders up there are bold enough to be the people who they are not the people that I think they ought to be on. One last bit of food for thought is great. Leadership's a tipping point. So when you start your leadership role you're developing yourself and it's necessary developing yourself developing yourself. And then there's a tipping point where you start developing others and you're happy developing others and you're happy giving people the glory of success. And that's where you start getting motivation. And that's when you start getting high performance teams on hype. Getting high performance teams is great leadership. Thank you very much
